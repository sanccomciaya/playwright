# How to Update Your OPEL DVD100 Navi with the Latest Maps of Europe
 
If you own an OPEL car with a DVD100 Navi system, you might be wondering how to get the latest maps of Europe for your navigation device. The DVD100 Navi is a reliable and easy-to-use system that can guide you to your destination with voice prompts and clear graphics. However, the maps on the DVD can become outdated over time, as roads and points of interest change. That's why it's important to update your maps regularly with the latest version available.

In this article, we will show you how to update your OPEL DVD100 Navi with the latest maps of Europe for 2014. This version covers Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Vatican City[^1^]. It also includes major roads of Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
 
To update your maps, you will need a blank DVD-R or DVD+R disc and a computer with a DVD burner. You will also need to download the map data from a reliable source. We recommend using [this link](http://ildezeme.over-blog.com/2020/12/Maps-Of-Europe-For-OPEL-DVD100-Navi-V20112012-14.html), which provides a torrent file that you can use with a BitTorrent client such as uTorrent or BitComet. The file size is about 650 MB and it contains the map data and the language CD for the DVD100 Navi.
 
Once you have downloaded the file, you will need to extract it using a program such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get two folders: one named "DVD100\_Europe\_2014" and another named "Language\_CD". Open the first folder and you will see an ISO file named "OPEL\_DVD100\_Europe\_2014.iso". This is the image file that you need to burn onto your blank DVD disc. You can use any software that can burn ISO files such as Nero or ImgBurn. Make sure you select the lowest possible burning speed and verify the disc after burning.
 
Next, open the second folder and you will see another ISO file named "OPEL\_DVD100\_Language\_CD.iso". This is the image file that contains the voice prompts and menu texts for different languages such as English, French, German, Italian and Spanish. You need to burn this file onto another blank DVD disc using the same method as before.
 
Now you are ready to update your OPEL DVD100 Navi with the latest maps of Europe. Follow these steps:
 
1. Turn on your car and insert the language CD into your DVD100 Navi.
2. Wait for the system to recognize the disc and display a message asking if you want to update the language data. Press "Yes".
3. The system will start copying the language data from the disc to its internal memory. This may take several minutes. Do not turn off your car or eject the disc during this process.
4. When the copying is finished, the system will ask you to remove the language CD and insert the map DVD. Press "OK" and eject the language CD.
5. Insert the map DVD into your DVD100 Navi.
6. Wait for the system to recognize the disc and display a message asking if you want to update the map data. Press "Yes".
7. The system will start copying the map data from the disc to its internal memory. This may take up to an hour. Do not turn off your car or eject the disc during this process.
8. When the copying is finished, the system will ask you to remove the map DVD and restart your navigation device. Press "OK" and eject the map DVD.
9. The system will restart automatically and load the new maps of Europe for 2014.
